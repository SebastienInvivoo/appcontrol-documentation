# Introduction


## What is AppControl ?

It's monitoring application for hardware and software.
We can automate responses to certain types of incidents, which helps maintain application performance and reduce downtime.

## How does it work ?

- Agents are elements that will monitor the operation of an application or an application element.
- Components are the representation of agents on our software.
- Gateways are the link between agents and components.
- Map is the link between agents. In particular, you can rebuild your application if each agent composes a part of your application.
- Operations are the actions that you can program on maps.
